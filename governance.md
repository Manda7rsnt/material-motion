# Governance

The Interactive Motion Starmap is a collaborative effort across many platforms.

The group of core contributors is self-managing - core contributors are added by two supporting votes from core contributors on the mailing list and no veto within four business days. We expect that new contributors will submit a number of patches before they become core contributors.
