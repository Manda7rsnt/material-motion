## Referring to types

We'll use the `Director` type as an example.

**Common**: Use lower-case, regular font variant when referring to directors in general.

Good examples:

- Use a director to describe an interaction.

**As a type**: Use camel-cased, typewriter font variant when referring to the `Director` type.

Good examples:

- Your class must conform to `Director`.
