# Overview

## Why a starmap?

The Material Motion team spans platforms, languages, personalities, and skill sets. We're driven by a common desire to improve the state of the art in interactive application design.

The Starmap is our forum for proposing and hashing out ideas.

## The hopeful future

**Describing motion will be as easy as describing shape and form.**

We can readily express intent with shape and color. What if motion and interaction were similarly expressive?

**The line between engineering and design tools will blur.**

Prototypes often must be translated in to production-ready code. What if tools and languages existed that could more effectively describe prototypes in production?

## Sustainable culture

**Operate in the open from day one.**

Everything we build is open source from day one. We believe that being open and transparent allows better solutions to come to light.

**Encourage community ownership.**

Open source projects are often driven by a core group of interested individuals. This presents an important risk to consider: what happens when the core group moves on to other projects?

We're inspired by the [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/contributors) project's take on community ownership. We grant responsibility in our community early and often. Gate keepers do exist at important steps in the process (cutting a release, pushing to stable).

**Casual contributors are important.**

We want anyone to feel capable of contributing to our projects. We accept pull requests. Feel free to reach out to the team via any of our [communication](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-team/content/community/communication.html) channels.

## What we plan to do

**Create motion runtimes for the expression of declarative motion.** These runtimes will serve as both a proof of concept and as a production-ready tool.

**Whenever possible, work with platforms to build native solutions that replace our runtimes.**

**Define a common motion language that spans platforms.**

**Create real-time motion debugging tools.**

**Create creative tools for declarative motion.**

**Encourage sharing and creation of motion languages.** The Material Motion's language will only be one of many.

The [material-motion GitHub org](https://github.com/material-motion) houses our implementations.
