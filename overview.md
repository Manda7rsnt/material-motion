# Overview

## Why a starmap?

The Material Motion team spans platforms, languages, personalities, and skill sets. We're driven by a common desire to improve the state of the art in interactive application design.

The Starmap is our forum for proposing and hashing out ideas.

## The future

**Describing motion will be as easy as describing shape and form.**

We can readily express intent with shape and color. What if motion and interaction were similarly expressive?

**The line between engineering and design tools will blur.**

Prototypes often must be translated in to production-ready code. What if tools and languages existed that could more effectively describe prototypes in production?

## Sustainable culture

**Operate in the open from day one.**

Everything we build is open source from day one. We believe that being open and transparent allows better solutions to come to light.

**Encourage community ownership.**

Open source projects are often driven by a core group of interested individuals. This presents an important risk to consider: what happens when the core group moves on to other projects?

We're applying a community structure in which responsibility is shared early and often. We have gate keepers at important steps in the process (cutting a release, pushing to stable). We hope to grow that pool of gate keepers in the future.

## What plan to do

- Create motion runtimes for the expression of declarative motion.
- Whenever possible, work with platforms to build native solutions that replace our runtimes.
- Define a common motion language that spans platforms.
- Create real-time motion debugging tools.
- Create creative tools for declarative motion.

## Creative constraints

We use constraints to explore creative solutions to problems. Some of the constraints we apply:

- What if we couldn't use a laptop to create our software?
- What if we couldn't use MVC to structure our applications?
