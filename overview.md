# Overview

## Why a starmap?

The Material Motion team spans platforms, languages, personalities, and skill sets. We're driven by a common desire to improve the state of the art in interactive application design.

The Starmap is our forum for proposing and hashing out ideas.

## The future

**Describing motion will be as easy as describing shape and form.**

We can readily express intent with shape and color. What if motion and interaction were similarly expressive?

**The line between engineering and design tools will blur.**

Prototypes often must be translated in to production-ready code. What if tools and languages existed that could more effectively describe prototypes in production?

## How we plan to get there

Operate in the open from day one.

Encourage community ownership.
