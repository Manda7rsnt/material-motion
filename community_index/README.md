## Suggested repository naming convention

The naming convention we suggest for repositories is:

    <your organization>-<starmap concept>-<language|platform>

Note that everything is lower-case. We recommend using hyphens to separate words.

The following names match the convention:

- material-motion-expression-tween-objc
- material-motion-expression-tween-swift
- material-motion-expression-tween-android
- material-motion-expression-tween-web
- material-motion-runtime-objc
- material-motion-runtime-android
- material-motion-runtime-web
- acme-corp-language-tween-swift

The following names do not match the convention:

- SwiftTweenLanguage
- TweenLanguage
- material-motion-Runtime
