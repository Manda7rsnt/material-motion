# Motion family

A motion family is a software library that includes one or more Plans and Performer implementations.

## Minimum requirements

A motion family must satisfy the following minimal requirements:

* At least one Plan and Performer type.
* All Performer types are private to the library.
* Has a dependency on the Runtime.
* Examples for every available Plan.

## Platform-specific bridge families

Existing animation and interaction systems can and should be bridged to Material Motion.
