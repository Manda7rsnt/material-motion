# Runtime plugins

Plugins are entities that are able to react to events generated by a Runtime.

## Events

A Runtime should generate events. These events should be observable by external entities.

`v1` **Event: runtime activity state did change**: Any time the Runtime changes its idle/active state it should fire an observable event.

This event enables "Transition Directors".

`feature: duplication` **Event: new target**: The Runtime should send an event each time a new target is referenced.

The receivers of this event should be allowed to set a new "shadow" instance of the target. The shadow instance will be provided to the Actors.

This event enables "view duplication".

## Experimental ideas

`feature: targetidle` **Event: target activity state did change**: Any time a specific target changes its idle/active state it should fire an observable event.

This event enables reactionary Intentions, i.e. registering new Intentions once a Target has entered an idle state.

> NOTE: It may be more valuable to have actor-level idling. Target-level idling may not be helpful. It's unclear how actor-level idling would work, given that the outside system should generally be unaware of actors. Perhaps you could use intentions as the entry-point:
>
>     transaction.add(intention, target, function() {
>       actor idle callback
>     })
