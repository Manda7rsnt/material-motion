# Tween motion family

The tween motion family allows a director to describe tween animations for properties on an element.

To consider:

- Cascading tweens; e.g. fade in this group of elements with a cascading effect. This is coordinated at the director level, but we should be able to easily describe such an effect.

> Note that this motion family can/should compose out to a bridge motion family for a given platform if a reasonable tween system already exists.
