# TransitionController specification

This is the engineering specification for the `TransitionController` object.

`TransitionController` is the bridge between the platform's transitioning architecture and the `TransitionDirector` type.

**Concrete type**: A `TransitionController` is a concrete type.

Example pseudo-code:

    TransitionController {
    }

**Transition director type API**: Provide an API for storing a `TransitionDirector` type.

The type must be a subclass of `TransitionDirector`.

Example pseudo-code:

    TransitionController {
      var directorType: type(TransitionDirector)
    }

The owner of a Transition Director is responsible for creating a Runtime and committing the Transaction.

Example pseudo-code:

    runtime = Runtime()
    transaction = Transaction()
    
    director = Director()
    director.setUp(transaction)
    
    runtime.commit(transaction)
