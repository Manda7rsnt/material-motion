# Engineering spec

This chapter is written to be both ðŸŒŸ aspirational ðŸŒŸ and ðŸ“š educational ðŸ“š.

Much of what we'll describe is not new. Some things we'll discuss have existed for decades. Where applicable we've included links to prior art and research.

This chapter defines technologies that we feel aid in the creation of interactive applications. Some solutions already exist and we've made efforts to link to them where applicable.

Within the best of our ability these specifications are platform and language-agnostic.
