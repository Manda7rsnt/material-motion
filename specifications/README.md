# Engineering concepts

This chapter contains software engineering concepts.

In the spirit of our Starmap, the tone of this chapter is highly aspirational.

Much of what we're describing is not new. Some things we'll discuss have existed for decades. Where applicable we've included links to prior art and research.

This chapter defines technologies that we feel aid in the creation of interactive applications. We challenge the reader to identify gaps in languages/platforms and to build solutions.

Within the best of our ability these specifications are platform and language-agnostic. We will not always be perfect, nor are we attempting to achieve perfect agreement.

The authors of this chapter have backgrounds in Android, iOS, and web application development.
