# Engineering spec

This chapter defines engineering specifications and concepts. This chapter is a platform-independent grounds to discuss implementation details.

The tone is meant to be both ðŸŒŸ aspirational ðŸŒŸ and ðŸ“š educational ðŸ“š.

The audience is software engineers interested in building motion and interaction systems.

Throughout this chapter we write statements as simple facts. All are open for debate and conversation.

Much of what we'll describe is not new. Some things we'll discuss have existed for decades. Where applicable, we've included links to both ours and others' work in the field.

Within the best of our ability the provided specifications are platform and language-agnostic.
