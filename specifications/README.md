# Engineering concepts

This chapter contains software engineering concepts.

In the spirit of our Starmap, the tone of this chapter is highly aspirational.

Much of what we're describing is not new. Some things we'll discuss have existed for decades, and we encourage the reader to dive in to relevant content where applicable.

The goal of this chapter is to define a clear set of engineering goals. Armed with these goals, we hope to empower software engineers to build solutions for their favorite language or platform.

Within the best of our ability these specifications are platform and language-agnostic. We will not always be perfect, nor are we attempting to achieve perfect agreement.
