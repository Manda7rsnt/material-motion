# Engineering concepts

This chapter is written to be both ðŸŒŸ aspirational ðŸŒŸ and educational.

Much of what we'll describe is not new. Some things we'll discuss have existed for decades. Where applicable we've included links to prior art and research.

This chapter defines technologies that we feel aid in the creation of interactive applications. We challenge the reader to identify gaps in languages/platforms and to build solutions.

Within the best of our ability these specifications are platform and language-agnostic. We will not always be perfect, nor are we attempting to achieve perfect agreement.
