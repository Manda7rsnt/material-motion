# Engineering spec

This chapter defines engineering specifications and concepts. This chapter is a platform-independent grounds to discuss implementation details.

The tone is meant to be both ðŸŒŸ aspirational ðŸŒŸ and ðŸ“š educational ðŸ“š.

The audience is software engineers interested in building motion and interaction systems.

Throughout this chapter we write statements as simple facts. All are open for debate and conversation.

Much of what we'll describe is not new. Some things we'll discuss have existed for decades. Where applicable, we've included links to both ours and others' work in the field.

Within the best of our ability the provided specifications are platform and language-agnostic. We assume that you're working with an object-oriented language. We're inspired by functional programming but apply a pragmatic approach to system design.

# Tech tree

The following chart is a [tech tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_tree) representation of the Starmap's engineering concepts. Dependencies are represented as arrows.

## Editing the tech tree

We use [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to edit the tech tree. Drag the .svg file in to draw.io and begin editing. Export the resulting content as an svg.

# Reading spec diagrams

We use spec diagrams to provide visual representations of the work required to build a particular thing. The following chart is an example of one of these diagrams.

We've annotated the important features.
