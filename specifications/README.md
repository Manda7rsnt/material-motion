# Engineering spec

This chapter defines engineering specifications and concepts. This chapter is a platform-independent grounds to discuss implementation details.

The tone is meant to be both ðŸŒŸ aspirational ðŸŒŸ and ðŸ“š educational ðŸ“š.

Statements are written as simple facts, but all are open for debate and conversation.

Much of what we'll describe is not new. Some things we'll discuss have existed for decades. Where applicable we've included links to prior art and research.

Within the best of our ability the provided specifications are platform and language-agnostic.
