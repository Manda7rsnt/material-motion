# Interaction specifications

An interaction specification describes a coherent interactive experience. Interactions can involve any number of plans and targets. The specificity of an interaction is left as an exercise to its creator.

Interactions should strive for being composable.

Productionized interactions are encouraged to make use of the [Director](director.md) type as a vessel for deploying interactions in a code base.

Prototype interactions are encouraged to use a flat file.
