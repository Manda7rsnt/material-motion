# Library structure

The following diagram details the libraries we intend to create. We use the term library to mean "a collection of objects or types that is as small as possible, but no smaller".

The diagram includes dependencies between each library.

This diagram does not include:

- plan/performer families. E.g. Tween, Gesturing.
- Specific Director implementations. E.g. PhotoDirector, FadeDirector, SlideUpDirector.
