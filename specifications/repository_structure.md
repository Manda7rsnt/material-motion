# Repository structure

The following diagram details the GitHub repositories we intend to create. Each repository contains a specific set of objects or types. We've also defined the required dependencies between each repository.

This diagram does not include:

- plan/executor families. E.g. Tween, Gesturing.
- Specific Director implementations. E.g. PhotoDirector, FadeDirector, SlideUpDirector.
