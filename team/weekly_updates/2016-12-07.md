## Documentation

üìù Created the home for where our L1-L4 documentation will live. [View the home page](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/documentation/).

## Starmap

üìù Iterating on streams spec. [Start here](https://material-motion.github.io/material-motion/starmap/specifications/streams/IndefiniteObservable).

üéâ Starmap now shows spec dependencies, knowledge levels, and the expected library a spec would live
   within for every spec page.
