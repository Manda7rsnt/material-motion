## Meta

Continued refinement of our reactive motion architecture. Starting to wind down for year-end
vacations.

[View all of our contributors](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTORS.md)

## Starmap

üìù Significant consolidation and cleanup of starmap content.

[View all changes since last week](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion/compare/2016-12-14...2016-12-21)

## Android platform

üéâ Streams MVP completed.

Includes gesture and spring stream sources.

## Apple platforms

üìù Prototyping interruptible bi-directional transitions with new reactive architecture.

üìù Modal dialog built with new reactive transitions architecture.

üìù Exploring concept of an "Interaction" as a unit of reusable motion.

üìù Prototype of a reactive interaction.

![](2016-12-21-tossable-card.gif)

In this example, we update the card's rotation in reaction to changes to its center position.

```swift
let rotationStream =
  propertyOf(card).centerX
  .offset(by: -view.bounds.width / 2)
  .normalized(by: view.bounds.width)
  .scaled(by: CGFloat(radians))
  .bounded(amin: -radians / 2, amax: radians / 2)
aggregator.write(rotationStream, to: propertyOf(card).rotation)
```

üìù Prototyping introspection of an interaction. The following diagram shows a rendered version of
the complete interaction shown above:

üìù [chuga](https://github.com/chuga) from the Remixer team prototyped a combination of Remixer and
Material Motion. An example of using Remixer to modify material motion spring configurations in real
time:

üéâ POP springs, Core Animation springs, Core Animation tweens, and gestures all landed as sources in
the new reactive architecture.

The following demo shows a Core Animation-backed spring animation that's reactively-interruptible:

The code for the above video uses two "Interactions": `TossableAndAttachWithSpring` and `Tap`. These
units of interaction are reusable pieces of motion. Over time we'll provide implementations of these
interactions on all platforms in the form of a consistent **library of motion**.

```swift
let tossable = TossableAndAttachWithSpring(position: propertyOf(square).center,
                                           to: propertyOf(circle).center,
                                           containerView: view,
                                           springSource: popSpringSource)
let tap = Tap(sets: tossable.destination, containerView: view)

[tossable, tap].forEach { interaction in interaction.connect(with: runtime) }
```

## Web frameworks

üéâ Added continuous integration.  See the badge on [our repo README](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-js/#readme).

üéâ `scrollSource` completed.

üìù Streams MVP nearing completion.

## Tooling

üéâ [tofuness](https://github.com/tofuness), one of our newest contributors, has helped get our
JavaScript testing environment up and running!
