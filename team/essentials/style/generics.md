# generics

We use generics across all platforms in order to support strongly-typed systems. This document
defines the names we use and what their intended uses are.

## Generic names

**T**: a value type.

**U**: a mapped value type.

**O**: an object type.

## Examples

map from **T** to **U**.

A property for an object **O** with a value **T**.
