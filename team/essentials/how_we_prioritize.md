# How we prioritize

Prioritization is how we choose what to work on for a given week or day. We make heavy use of GitHub and Discord to communicate our priorities. This allows us to minimize the number of team meetings and encourages autonomy.

## Sprints

We use GitHub's org-wide projects to organize our weekly sprints. You must be a member of the material-motion organization to view the sprint board. [Ask a core team member on Discord for access](https://discord.gg/ZJyGXza).

## A milestone defines relative issue priority

Within a given library we use GitHub milestones to define relative issue priority. Issues at the top of the milestone are the most important.

For example, consider the [Runtime v1.0.0 milestone](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-runtime-objc/milestone/1):

In this milestone we can clearly see the work ahead of us and the current status of each issue.

If you'd like to take on a task the rule is simple: **choose any unassigned task near the top of the milestone**.
