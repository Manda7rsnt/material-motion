# Expressions

An Expression is functional syntactic sugar for the creation and configuration of Intentions.

Through the following examples we will explore the essential aspects of an Expression:

1. `expression = Tween()`
2. `expression = Tween().fadeIn()`
3. `expression = Tween().fadeIn().withEasingCurve(easeOut)`
4. `expression = Gesture().pinchable().rotatable().draggable()`
5. `expression.intentions()`

## 1. Languages

```expression = Tween()```

Expressions begin with a Language. A Language is an instance of an object.

Languages have **terms**.

For example, the Tween Language definition might look like:

```
Tween {
  fn fadeIn(...) -> Term
  fn fadeOut(...) -> Term
  fn moveTo(...) -> Term
  fn rotateBy(...) -> Term
  ...
}
```

**Scope**: The purpose of a Language object is to define a lexical scope for a particular set of terms. This allows an ecosystem of Languages to exist where some Languages may have similar or identical terms. The responsibility of any given Languageâ€™s creator is to clearly explain what a term will do. This documentation would be ideally represented as a visual interactive dictionary.

**Capitalization**: Language names start with a capital letter. Terms start with a lowercase letter.
