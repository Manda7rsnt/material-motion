# Documentation

Welcome to the Material Motion documentation. There's not much here yet.

## Knowledge levels

We categorize the education of Material Motion into the following groups:

1. App creator
2. Director creator
3. Motion creator
4. Runtime engineering

Each group in the list above requires more knowledge of the Material Motion ecosystem than the group preceding it.

## Expectations

**App creator**: uses Directors and Interactions to create apps.

**Interaction creator**: uses Streams to create Directors and Interactions.

**Stream creator**: uses the observable pattern to create Streams.

**Runtime engineer**: uses platform-specific considerations to build the runtime.

> Note that the Starmap is written for runtime engineers.

## Methods of positioning these expectations

We will provide distinct categories of educational material targeted toward each knowledge level:

- L1: **using** material motion
- L2-3: **extending** material motion.
