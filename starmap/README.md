# Material Motion Starmap

This document describes a system that will empower creators with the language and tools needed to describe and implement rich, interactive motion on any platform. Within, we explore [essential primitives](specifications/primitives), [software design patterns](specifications/pattern), [motion runtimes](specifications/runtime), and more. Initially, we will be supporting Android, iOS, and the web.

This is a starmap. It defines high-level goals and identifies patterns. It is not the API documentation for any particular solution. [Join our Discord channel](https://discord.gg/ZJyGXza) to chat with the team.

**The Starmap will evolve over time.**

Please read the chapter on [Starmap contributor essentials]({{ site.url }}/team/starmap_essentials/) to learn how to contribute to the Starmap.

## Is Material Motion affiliated with Google?

Yes, the [Material Motion](https://github.com/material-motion) organization is one of Google's new homes for tools and frameworks related to our [Material Design](https://material.io) system, specifically surrounding motion and interaction.

## Who should read this?

The Starmap is written for software engineers building a Material Motion system. We assume that you have some familiarity with animation systems.

## Announcements

We will send announcements to the `material-motion-announce` google group. [Subscribe to the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/material-motion-announce) to receive announcements.
