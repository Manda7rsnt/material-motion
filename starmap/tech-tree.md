# Tech tree

Material Motion is a large project with many moving parts. To ensure that an implementor can make
reasonable iterations, we've provided the following tech chart. This chart splits Material Motion
into separate arcs of development.

There are two zoom levels to this chart: milestones and features.

A completed milestone represents a usable product. A milestone is composed of features.
