# Streams

A light-weight implementation of the Observable pattern designed specifically for use in motion
design. It is based in spirit upon the
[ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io/documentation/observable.html) specification, though we've
intentionally trimmed the operators down to the bare essentials required for motion design.
