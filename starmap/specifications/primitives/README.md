# Motion primitives

This section explores some **building blocks** of rich, interactive motion.

This section's topics:

- [Gesture recognition](gesture_recognizers)
- [Tweens](tweens)
- [Applied forces](applied_forces)
- [Timeline](Timeline)
- [Streams](streams)

Most of these primitives represent change over time.

> Time in a computer is not limited to wall-clock time - it can slow down, stop, or reverse. It can jump to arbitrary moments and external systems can control it. When we use the word time we mean this understanding of "computer time".

Please note that these primitives can apply to an arbitrary number of dimensions and types of input.
