## Tweens

**What it is**: *an interpolation through each value in a list of values over a length of time*.

Tweens have a **starting time** and a **duration**. The starting time and duration properties allow tweens to be sequenced in relation to other tweens.

Tweens use an **interpolation function**. This is often a cubic-bezier, but could be any mathematical equation accepting time as an input.
