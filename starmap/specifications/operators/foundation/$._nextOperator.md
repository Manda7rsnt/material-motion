# _nextOperator specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator: `_nextOperator`.

## Overview

`_nextOperator` is a means by which new operators can be created. An operator can change, add, or
remove values in the stream. An operator can also change the type of emitted values.

## MVP

### Expose _nextOperator API

`operation` should be a function that receives two arguments: the value `T` from upstream and a callback that dispatches a value on the `next` channel.  It will be called every time a new `T` is received from upstream.

```swift
class MotionObservable<T> {
  public func _nextOperator<U>(operation: (T, (U) -> Void) -> Void) -> MotionObservable<U>
```

### Pass next to the operation function

The operation should only be allowed to invoke `next`. Pass the observer's next function to the
operation.

```swift
class MotionObservable<T> {
  public func _nextOperator<U>(operation: (T, (U) -> Void) -> Void) -> MotionObservable<U>
    return MotionObservable<U> { observer in
      let subscription = self.subscribe(next: { value in
        operation(value, observer.next)
      }
      return {
        subscription.unsubscribe()
      }
    }
  }
}
```
