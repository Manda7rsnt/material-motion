# _read specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` convenience method: `_read`.

## Overview

`_read` subscribes to a stream and synchronously returns the first emitted value, if any.

> Note: this API is provided as a **stop-gap solution** for building connected streams. In general
> it's preferred that streams be subscribed to and their last values cached in some manner. The
> `_remember` operator can be a helpful tool for making this easier:

```swift
let memoryStream = stream._remember()
let subscription = memoryStream.subscribe { value in
  // No need to do anything.
}

// Later, when we need the value:
let latestValue = memoryStream._read()
```

## MVP

### Expose _read API

```swift
class MotionObservable<T> {

  public func _read() -> T? {
    var value: T?
    self.subscribe { value = $0 }
    return value
  }
```
