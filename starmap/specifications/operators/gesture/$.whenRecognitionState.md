# $<GestureRecognizer>.whenRecognitionState specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator `whenRecognitionState` that
operates on GestureRecognizer value types.

## Overview

Only invoke next when the gesture recognizer's state matches the provided states.

Example usage:

```swift
gestureSource(gesture).whenRecognitionState(began)
```

## MVP

### Expose whenRecognitionState API

Should delegate to `_filter`. This API should only be available for streams emitting
GestureRecognizer values.

The output of this operator should be a GestureRecognizer.

```swift
extension MotionObservable where T: GestureRecognizer {
  public func whenRecognitionState(state: GestureRecognizerState) -> MotionObservable<T> {
    return _filter { value in
      return value.state == state
    }
  }
```
