# $<GestureRecognizer>.whenRecognitionStates specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator `whenRecognitionStates` that
operates on GestureRecognizer value types.

## Overview

Only invoke next when the gesture recognizer's state matches the provided states.

Example usage:

```swift
gestureSource(gesture).whenRecognitionStates([began, changed])
```

## MVP

### Expose whenRecognitionStates API

Should delegate to `_filter`. This API should only be available for streams emitting
GestureRecognizer values.

The output of this operator should be a GestureRecognizer.

```swift
extension MotionObservable where T: GestureRecognizer {
  public func whenRecognitionStates(states: [UIGestureRecognizerState]) -> MotionObservable<T> {
    return _filter { value in
      return states.contains(value.state)
    }
  }
```
