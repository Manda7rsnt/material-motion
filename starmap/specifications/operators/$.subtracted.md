# $.subtractedFrom specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator: `$.subtractedFrom`.

## Overview

`$.subtractedFrom` emits the result of subtracting the incoming value from a given value.

Example usage:

```swift
normalizedValueStream.subtracted(from: 1)
```

## MVP

### Expose a $.subtractedFrom API

Use `_map` to implement the operator. Accept a number value. Emit the result of `value - incoming`.

```swift
class MotionObservable {
  public func subtracted(from value: number) -> MotionObservable<number>
```
