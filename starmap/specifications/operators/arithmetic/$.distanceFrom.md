# $.distance specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator: `$.distance`.

## Overview

`$.distance` emits the absolute distance from the incoming value and the provided location.

Example usage:

```swift
stream.distanceFrom(midX)

upstream  location   downstream
20        50         30
40        50         10
80        50         30
```

## MVP

### Expose a 1-dimensional $.distance API

Use `_map` to implement the operator. Accept a location number. Emit a number which is the
result of `abs(incoming - location)`.

```swift
class MotionObservable<number> {
  public func distance(from location: number) -> MotionObservable<number>
```

### Expose a 2-dimensional $.distance API

Use `_map` to implement the operator. Accept a location point. Emit a number which is the
result of `sqrt((incoming.x - location.x)^2 - (incoming.y - location.y)^2)`.

```swift
class MotionObservable<Point2D> {
  public func distance(from location: Point2D) -> MotionObservable<number>
```
