# Transitions

A transition causes a visual change from one element hierarchy to another.

Transitions are a specialized subset of general interactions with different meanings on different platforms:

- iOS: UIViewController transitions
- Android: Activity transitions
- Web: URL transitions

The considerations for each platform are diverse and often distinct. To reflect this, the transitions spec is split into two parts: **common specs** and **platform specs**.

## Common specs

- [Directionality](directionality)
- [Life of a transition director](life_of_a_transition_director)
- [ContextTransition](ContextTransition)
- [ContextTransitionDirector](ContextTransitionDirector)

## Platform specs

- [iOS](platform/ios/)
