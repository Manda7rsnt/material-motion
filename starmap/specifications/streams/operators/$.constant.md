# $.constant specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator: `$.constant`.

## Overview

`$.constant` emits a constant value every time it receives a new value.

Example usage:

```swift
gestureSource(tap).onRecognitionState(.recognized).constant(midPointX)
```

## MVP

### Expose a $.constant API

Use `_map` to implement the operator. Accept a constant of type `U`. Always emit this value when a
new value is received.

```swift
class MotionObservable {
  public func constant<U>(_ value: U) -> MotionObservable<U>
```
