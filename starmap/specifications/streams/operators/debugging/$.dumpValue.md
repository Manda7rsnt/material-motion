# $.dumpValue specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator: `$.dumpValue`.

## Overview

`$.dumpValue` writes any incoming value to the console and passes the value along.

Example usage:

```swift
distanceStream.dumpValue()
```

## MVP

### Expose a $.dumpValue API

Use `_nextOperator` to implement the operator.

```swift
class MotionObservable {
  public func dumpValue() -> MotionObservable<T>
```
