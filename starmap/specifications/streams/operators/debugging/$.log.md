# $.log specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator: `$.log`.

## Overview

`$.log` writes any incoming value to the console and passes the value along.

Example usage:

```swift
distanceStream.log()
```

## MVP

### Expose a $.log API

Use `_nextOperator` to implement the operator.

```swift
class MotionObservable {
  public func log() -> MotionObservable<T>
```
