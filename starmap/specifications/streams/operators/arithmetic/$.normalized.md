# $.normalized specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator: `$.normalized`.

## Overview

`$.normalized` emits the result of dividing the incoming value by a given value.

Example usage:

```swift
distanceStream.normalized(by: screenWidth)
```

## MVP

### Expose a $.normalized API

Use `_map` to implement the operator. Accept a number value. Emit the result of `incoming / value`.

```swift
class MotionObservable {
  public func normalized<U>(by value: number) -> MotionObservable<number>
```
