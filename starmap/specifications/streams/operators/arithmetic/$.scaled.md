# $.scaled specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator: `$.scaled`.

## Overview

`$.scaled` emits the result of multiplying the incoming value by a given value.

Example usage:

```swift
distanceStream.scaled(by: screenWidth)
```

## MVP

### Expose a $.scaled API

Use `_map` to implement the operator. Accept a number value. Emit the result of `incoming * value`.

```swift
class MotionObservable {
  public func scaled<U>(by value: number) -> MotionObservable<number>
```
