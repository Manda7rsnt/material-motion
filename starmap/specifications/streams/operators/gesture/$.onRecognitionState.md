# $<GestureRecognizer>.onRecognitionState specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator `onRecognitionState` that
operates on GestureRecognizer value types.

## Overview

Only invoke next when the gesture recognizer's state matches the provided states.

Example usage:

```swift
gestureSource(gesture).onRecognitionState(began)
```

## MVP

### Expose onRecognitionState API

Should delegate to `_filter`. This API should only be available for streams emitting
GestureRecognizer values. Provide two APIs: one that accepts a single state and another that accepts
a collection of states.

The output of this operator should be a GestureRecognizer.

```swift
extension MotionObservable where T: GestureRecognizer {
  public func onRecognitionState(state: GestureRecognizerState) -> MotionObservable<T> {
    return _filter { value in
      return value.state == state
    }
  }

  public func onRecognitionState(states: [UIGestureRecognizerState]) -> MotionObservable<T> {
    return _filter { value in
      return states.contains(value.state)
    }
  }
```
