# $.toggled specification

This is the engineering specification for the `MotionObservable` operator: `toggled`.

## Overview

`toggled` emits events from the stream unless a given preferred stream is active, in which case
the preferred stream is what emits. This operator will only emit values from the curently active
and preferred stream.

This operator is presently only intended to be used with gesture and spring sources.

Stream diagram where each `O` is an operator, `-` indicates a subscription, `>` indicates data flow:

```
drag$     O   O   O
                    
spring$ O   O   O   O   O
                    ^
                    .toggled(with: drag$) operator
```

Upon subscription:

While `drag$` is active:

```
drag$     O-->O-->O
                   \
spring$ O   O   O   O-->O
                    ^
                    .toggled operator
```

While `drag$` is at rest:

```
drag$     O---O---O
                   \
spring$ O-->O-->O-->O-->O
                    ^
                    .toggled operator
```

Example usage:

```swift
let drag$ = gestureSource(dragGesture)
let spring$ = springSource(spring)
let position$ = spring$.toggled(with: drag$.location(in: view))

// <subscribe to position$ and write it to a property>
```

## MVP

### Expose toggled API

Return a new MotionObservable of type T.

```swift
class MotionObservable<T> {

  public func toggled(with preferredStream: MotionObservable<T>) -> MotionObservable<T>
```

### Keep track of two Subscriptions and the active stream

This operator will subscribe to two streams. On disconnect, unsubscribe from both streams.

We need to track which stream we're allowing to emit downstream, so introduce an enum representing
the possible states. We can't guarantee that we'll receive a `state` channel update before `next`,
so we start off in an `unknown` state. In this state we prefer emitting the preferred stream's
values.

```swift

  private enum WhichStream {
    case unknown
    case preferred
    case this
  }

  func toggled(with preferredStream: MotionObservable<T>) -> MotionObservable<T> {
    return MotionObservable<T> { observer in
      var preferredSubscription: Subscription?
      var otherSubscription: Subscription?

      var emittingStream = WhichStream.unknown

      ...

      return {
        preferredSubscription?.unsubscribe()
        otherSubscription?.unsubscribe()
      }
    }
  }
```

### Immediately subscribe to preferredStream

```swift
  func toggled(with preferredStream: MotionObservable<T>) -> MotionObservable<T> {
    return MotionObservable<T> { observer in
      ...
      
      preferredSubscription = preferred$.subscribe(next: { value in
      }, state: { state in
      })
      
      ...
    }
  }
```

### Only emit from preferred stream while it's active

Check whether we can emit values from the preferred stream before emitting them.

```swift
  func toggled(with preferredStream: MotionObservable<T>) -> MotionObservable<T> {
    return MotionObservable<T> { observer in
      ...
      
      preferredSubscription = preferred$.subscribe(next: { value in
        if emittingStream == .preferred {
          observer.next(value)
        }

      }, state: { state in
        ...
      })
      
      ...
    }
  }
```

### Toggle original subscription based on state

If the preferred stream comes to rest, we subscribe to the original stream. If the preferred
stream becomes active, we unsubscribe from the original stream. original stream means the stream to
which this operator was added.

```swift
  func toggled(with preferredStream: MotionObservable<T>) -> MotionObservable<T> {
    return MotionObservable<T> { observer in
      ...
      
      preferredSubscription = preferred$.subscribe(next: { value in
        ...

      }, state: { state in
        emittingStream = (state == .active) ? .preferred : .this

        if state == .atRest && otherSubscription == nil {
          otherSubscription = self.subscribe(next: observer.next, state: observer.state)
        }

        if emittingStream == .preferred {
          observer.state(state)
        }

        if state == .active && otherSubscription != nil {
          otherSubscription?.unsubscribe()
          otherSubscription = nil
        }
      })
      
      ...
    }
  }
```
