# Minimize design/engineering handoff

One goal of the Material Motion project is to eliminate the concept of a design/engineering "hand
off". By encouring both designers and engineers to think of motion in a common language, we hope to
see the line blur between what is motion design and what is engineering.

**Guaranteed near future**: not far from the status quo.

**The ideal future**: design/engineering working in tandem to create interactive, production-ready
experiences.
