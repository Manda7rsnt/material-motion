# Overview

## Why a starmap?

The Material Motion team spans platforms, languages, personalities, and skill sets. We're driven by a common desire to improve the state of the art in interactive application design.

The Starmap is our forum for proposing and hashing out ideas. It allows us to converge on shared considerations and to discuss long-term goals.

## Our goals

**Nurture software design patterns for motion and interaction**

**Blur the line between engineering and design**

**Provide a catalog of motion**

## Sustainable culture

**Operate in the open from day one**

**Encourage community ownership**

**Lower the barrier to casual contribution**

# Education groups

We categorize the education of Material Motion into the following groups:

1. App creator
2. Director creator
3. Motion creator
4. Runtime engineering

Each group in the list above requires more knowledge of the Material Motion ecosystem than the group preceding it.

## Knowledge expectations

**App creator**: knows how to use and compose Directors.

**Director creator**: also knows how to create Directors and use Plans.

**Motion creator**: also knows how to create Plans/Performers.

**Runtime engineer**: also knows how to modify the runtime.

Creators should rarely, if ever, have to acquire an understanding of runtime engineering.

The Starmap is written for the runtime engineering group.

## Methods of positioning these expectations

Provide two categories of educational material: **using** material motion and **extending** material motion.

Using material motion will target app creators.

Extending material motion will target director/motion creators.

## Knowledge hierarchy

The following diagram shows the required amount of knowledge for each group.

# The design/engineering handoff

One hopeful outcome of the Material Motion project is to remove the design/engineering "hand off". By encouring both designers and engineers to think of motion in a common language, we hope to see the line blur between what is motion design and what is engineering.

**Guaranteed near future**: not far from the status quo.

**The ideal future**: design/engineering working in tandem to create interactive, production-ready experiences.
