### Pivotal journey: Communicate a motion idea to an engineer

#### Assumptions

The motion designer has heard of Material Motion and would like to make use of it.

#### End-goal

A designerâ€™s idea is realized in production code.

#### Ideal journey (does not exist yet)

1. Designer visits &lt;material motion website&gt;. 
2. Designer visits &lt;motion design/language page&gt;. 
3. Designer reads a one-pager on how to use go/direct to describe motion using the Material Motion language. 
4. Designer sends a link of the go/direct page to the engineer. 
5. Engineer exports the go/direct specification as code. 
6. Engineer embeds the code in their application. 
7. Engineer makes adjustments to the code as necessary.
