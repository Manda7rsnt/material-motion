# Interactive Motion Starmap

Interactivity and motion play an increasingly important role in software interfaces. And yet, there is often a gap between what a software creator can imagine and what can be built in production code.

This book aspires to empower creators with the language and tools needed to describe and implement rich, interactive motion. Within, we'll explore software design patterns, essential primitives, motion runtimes, and more.

The initial authors have a history of shipping production software interfaces for a variety of platforms. Many of these initial authors are software engineers and motion designers.

Each concept in the Starmap represents a concrete **goal** — a guiding star — to guide development.

## Evolution

This book will evolve over time. Please start discussions by leaving comments in-line or by [filing issues](https://github.com/material-motion/material-motion-starmap/issues/) on the GitHub repository.

This book is the goal state we want to get to and will help us measure success. It is neither a schedule, nor is it a list of relative priorities.

We are writing this book in the open because we believe that sharing these ideas will lead to innovations we can't yet imagine.
