# Interactive Motion Starmap

This book aspires to empower creators with the language and tools needed to describe and implement rich, interactive motion. Within, we explore [essential primitives](primitives.md), [software design patterns](plan-execution-pattern.md), [motion runtimes](concepts/runtimes.md), and more.

This book is a starmap. It defines high-level goals and identifies patterns.
