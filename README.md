# Interactive Motion Starmap

Interactivity and motion play an important role in software interfaces. Yet there is often a gap between what a software creator can imagine and what can be built in production applications.

This book aspires to empower creators with the language and tools needed to describe and implement rich, interactive motion. Within, we explore [software design patterns](concepts/patterns.md), [essential primitives](concepts/primitives.md), [motion runtimes](concepts/runtimes.md), and more.

> We're still writing this book; feel free to leave comments, but many chapters and sections are actively changing. We're planning out work on the Starmap in the [Roadmap](ROADMAP.md).

## Evolution

This book is expected to evolve over time. Please feel free to [start discussions](https://www.gitbook.com/book/material-motion/material-motion-starmap/discussions) or to leave comments in-line.

Please read the chapter on [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to contribute to this book.

## Who should read this?

[Concepts](concepts/) and [Applications](applications/) are both written for software engineers. We assume a certain level of background including:

- familiarity with at least one programming language, and
- familiarity with animation systems.

[Languages](languages/) and [Hypotheticals](hypotheticals/) are both written for anyone interested in interactive motion.

## Implementations

This book explores ideas that may or may not exist on a given platform or for a given language. For an index of existing and in-development solutions, please consult the [Community](community/) chapter.
