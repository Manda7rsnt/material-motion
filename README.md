# Interactive Motion Starmap

This book aspires to empower creators with the language and tools needed to describe and implement rich, interactive motion. Within, we explore [essential primitives](primitives.md), [software design patterns](plan-execution-pattern.md), [motion runtimes](concepts/runtimes.md), and more.

## Evolution

This book is in a very early drafting phase. We expect it to evolve over time.
