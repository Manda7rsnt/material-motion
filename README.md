# Interactive Motion Starmap

Interactivity and motion play an increasingly important role in software interfaces. Yet there is often a gap between what a software creator can imagine and what can be built in production code.

This book aspires to empower creators with the language and tools needed to describe and implement rich, interactive motion. Within, we explore software design patterns, essential primitives, coordinated motion runtimes, and more.
