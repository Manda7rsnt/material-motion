# Interactive Motion Starmap

This book aspires to empower creators with the language and tools needed to describe and implement rich, interactive motion. Within, we explore [software design patterns](concepts/patterns.md), [essential primitives](concepts/primitives.md), [motion runtimes](concepts/runtimes.md), and more.

## Evolution

This book is expected to evolve over time; planned work is in the [Roadmap](https://material-motion.gitbooks.io/material-motion-team/content/roadmaps/meta.html). 

Please read the chapter on [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how to contribute to this book. Feel free to [start discussions](https://www.gitbook.com/book/material-motion/material-motion-starmap/discussions) or to leave comments in-line.

## Who should read this?

The sections "[Concepts](concepts/)" and "[Applications](applications/)" are both written for software engineers. We assume a certain level of background including:

- familiarity with at least one programming language, and
- familiarity with animation systems.

The sections "[Languages](languages/)" and "[Hypotheticals](hypotheticals/)" are both written for anyone interested in interactive motion.

## Implementations

This book explores ideas that may or may not exist on a given platform or for a given language. For an index of existing and in-development solutions, please consult the [Community index](community_index/).
