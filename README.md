# Material Motion ðŸŒŸ Starmap ðŸ“œ

This document describes a system that will empower creators with the language and tools needed to describe and implement rich, interactive motion on any platform. Within, we explore [essential primitives](specifications/primitives.md), [software design patterns](specifications/pattern.md), [motion runtimes](specifications/runtime/), and more. Initially, we will be supporting Android, iOS, and the web, with variants and styles appropriate to each platform.

This is a starmap. It defines high-level goals and identifies patterns. It is not the API documentation for any particular solution. Our [Community index](community_index/) links to implementations for specific platforms and languages.

**This book is in a very early drafting phase. It will evolve over time. Beware of construction. ![](_assets/under-construction-flashing-barracade-animation-Material-Yellow-500.gif)**
