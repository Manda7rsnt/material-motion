# The Language of Motion

Motion design terminology is fragmented.  What some platforms refer to as "incoming easing" is called "ease out" on others.

To ensure we're all speaking the same language, the terminology we use throughout the Material Motion is defined here.

For our language to be effective, it must enable people to naturally express a complete **thought** that accurately describes an animation.  Each **thought** begins with an **action** and is followed by a string of **connectors** and **values**.

## Examples

A simple thought:

> Move by (0,100) over 300ms

| Action | Connector | Value | Connector | Value |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Move | by | (0,100) | over | 300ms |

or a more complex one:

> Move from (0,0) to (0,100) over 300ms with Easing

| Action | Connector | Value | Connector | Value | Connector | Value | Connector | Value |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Move | from | (0,0) | to | (0,100) | over | 300ms | with | Easing |
