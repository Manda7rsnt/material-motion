# Motion Language

Motion design comes with a large set of unique language and terminology. The language defined here is used as the base of the Material Motion framework.

When thinking about language, being able to naturally produce a sentence in a complete **thought** that accurately describes the animation is important to its success.

Each sentence begins with an **action** and is followed by a string of **connectors** and **values** to form a complete **thought**.

**Thought** example:

> Move by (0,100) over 300ms

| Action | Connector | Value | Connector | Value |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Move | by | (0,100) | over | 300ms |

or a more complex **thought** example:

> Move from (0,0) to (0,100) over 300ms with Easing

| Action | Connector | Value | Connector | Value | Connector | Value | Connector | Value |
| -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- | -- |
| Move | from | (0,0) | to | (0,100) | over | 300ms | with | Easing |
