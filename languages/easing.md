# Easing

Easing affects the velocity of an animating property.

TODO: Figure out the values for acceleration and deceleration amounts. Maybe these aren't the right terms to use here, and we need to define easing more mathematically.


### Acceleration

Easing is applied to the beginning of the animation to make it speed up from a stop.


### Deceleration

Easing is applied to the end of the animation to make it slow down to a stop.


### Constant

Easing is not applied, and the velocity is constant throughout the tween.
