# Simulation

Simulated physics used to achieve an animation.


### Friction

Affects how long it takes and how far an object travels while decelerating.


### Resistance

Affects how far an object moves in relation to the actual drag distance.


### Overshoot

Affects how many times an object overshoots its target location before coming to a rest.


### Attraction

Describes the relationship between objects that are magnetically attracted to one another.


### Repulsion

Describes the relationship between objects that are magnetically repelled by one another.
