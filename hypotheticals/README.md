# Hypotheticals

TODO: Provide ways to measure success. Capture hypotheticals we want to be able to express.

This is also where our litmus tests will live.

Rough hypothetical:

> say you have a scrollview, and as you scroll down it hides the appbar. You could model that as a timeline driven by scroll offset assuming you want it to be continuous and now you want to add a case where if you ever scroll upward, regardless of current scroll offset, re-show the header with a timed animation and afterward, if you scroll down it re-hides continuously
