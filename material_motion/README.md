# Material Motion Language

The Material Motion team is a cross-functional group working together to define a common Motion Language. Our goal is to reach a consensus within our small team. We do not hope to achieve — nor are we trying to reach — universal consensus.

The Material Motion Language is defined in two ways: the Grammar and the [Dictionary](dictionary.md).

The Grammar defines the structure of the language and the relevant "parts of speech".

The Dictionary is an exhaustive alphabetical list of terms and their definitions.
