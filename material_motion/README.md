# Material Motion

The Material Motion team is a cross-functional group working together to define a common Language of Motion. Our goal is to reach a consensus within our small team. We do not hope to achieve universal consensus of the terms we choose.

There are two parts to the definition of the Language of Motion: the Grammar and the Dictionary.

The Grammar defines the structure of the language and the relevant "parts of speech".

The Dictionary is an exhaustive alphabetical list of terms and their definitions.

The Grammar may reference the Dictionary.
