## Repository naming convention

The naming convention we use for repositories is:

    <organization>-<concept>-<language|platform>

Note that everything is lower-case. We use hyphens to separate words.

The following names match the convention:

- material-motion-language-tween-objc
- material-motion-language-tween-swift
- material-motion-language-tween-android
- material-motion-language-tween-web
- material-motion-runtime-objc
- material-motion-runtime-android
- material-motion-runtime-web

The following names do not match the convention:

- SwiftTweenLanguage
- TweenLanguage
- material-motionRuntime
